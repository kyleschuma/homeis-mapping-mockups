# Mock up project for HomeIs.blog

I'm playing around with some mapping ideas for HomeIs.blog, and this is repo where I'm keeping those ideas. The code here is dirty and won't make it into a final product. So if you want to take a look, go ahead but don't expect anything to production quality.

## Getting Started

Get an access token from [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/); this will require signing up.

Create a file named 'mapbox-token.js' in the ./src directory, include this snippet in the new file.

    export default '<YOUR-MAPBOX-TOKEN>';

Install packages and start the dev server

    $ yarn && yarn dev
